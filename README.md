# TailFlux Templates - AI Generated TailwindCSS Templates

Welcome to the official repository for TailFlux Templates! This is where we share beautiful, AI-generated Tailwind CSS templates, crafted by a machine that dreams in hexadecimal.

## About TailFlux

[TailFlux.com](https://www.tailflux.com) is a project where we handed the keys to an AI and said, "Go build something cool." The result is a pipeline that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate high-quality Tailwind CSS templates. This repository is the AI's public sketchbook, where all its creations and their screenshots are automatically pushed for you to enjoy.

We believe in open source, sharing knowledge, and the possibility that our AI might one day ask for stock options.

## Usage and Disclaimer

You are free to use, modify, and distribute these templates in any way you see fit. Go wild. Use them for your billion-dollar startup or for that website you're making for your cat.

However, these templates are provided "as is." We take no responsibility for their use. If a button summons a rubber chicken or a layout accidentally solves cold fusion, that's on you. You have been warned.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

*   **Photo Usage**: The images used in these templates are sourced from the wonderful humans at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). While the photos are free to use, please credit the original photographers. They climb mountains and wrestle bears (probably) to get those shots, so a little credit is the least we can do.

*   **Development Stage**: This project is still in its early stages, and our AI is still learning. It's brilliant, but sometimes it thinks a `<div>` is a type of futuristic burrito. Always double-check the generated code to ensure it meets your specific needs before deploying it into the wild.

## Happy Coding!

We hope these templates help you build amazing things. May your bugs be few and your coffee be strong.

Happy coding!
